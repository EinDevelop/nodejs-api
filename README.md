# Lanjrud Website NodeJS Api

this API make with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB database for this [Website](https://lanjrud.ir)

## Description

First I used simple way for routing & work with data. Now I think is better to refactor it and make it clean and standard.
For better performance anywhere I used new way, I marked it with ```Refactored``` comment.
